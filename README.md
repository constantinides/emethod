# E-methodHW – Polynomial and Rational Function Approximations for FPGAs

This project proposes an automatic method for the evaluation of functions via polynomial or rational approximations and its hardware implementation, on FPGAs.

These approximations are evaluated using Ercegovac's iterative E-method

 adapted for FPGA implementation.

The polynomial and rational function coefficients are optimized such that they satisfy the constraints of the E-method.
